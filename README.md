#### Web Standards Site Case Study (Figma + HTML/CSS)

This project is a case study focused on designing and developing a **web standards-compliant site** with an emphasis on accessibility and compatibility. I created the visual mockups using **Figma** and then translated them into a live web page with **HTML and CSS**. This process was centered on understanding how a design can be effectively implemented in a web environment.

#### Key Aspects of the Project
* **Website Design with Figma:** I meticulously designed the site's layout, colors, and typography in Figma, with careful consideration for user experience and web accessibility.
* **HTML/CSS Coding for Web Standards:** The project utilizes HTML5 semantic tags to ensure a clear page structure and CSS to implement the visual design.
